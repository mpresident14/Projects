Fantastic work! The information you uncovered
will go a long way towards thwarting the KGB's
plans. Uh-oh! Sounds like Alej is coming back
to the room. You can't let him discover your
secret identity, so you'll have to wait until
tomorrow to investigate further. (But maybe
he'll squish Ralph and you won't need to do
anything else!) Great job, Pikachu!
