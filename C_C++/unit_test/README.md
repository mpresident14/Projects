# UnitTest
A program to unit test your code.

Instructions for using the UnitTest class:

1. Declare a global UnitTest object with `createTest`.

2. Write each of your tests in separate functions. Use `affirm` to check statements that should be true.

3. In your main function, call each of your tests.

See example.cpp for a sample use of the UnitTest class.
