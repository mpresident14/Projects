You, Pikachu, are an MI6 agent undercover in
Claremont, CA, USA. You have been sent to spy
on a rogue KGB agent who is only known by the
pseudonym Ralph. After many weeks of searching,
you found him at Claremont Mckenna College,
hiding out in the room of a student named Alej.
Your mission is to find out what's he's up to
without giving away your identity. Good luck!
