Fantastic work! The information you uncovered
will go a long way towards thwarting the KGB's
plans. Uh-oh! Sounds like Alej and Miles are
coming back. You can't let them discover your
secret identity, so you'll have to wait until
tomorrow to investigate further. (But maybe
they'll squish Ralph and you won't need to do
anything else!) Great job, Pikachu!
